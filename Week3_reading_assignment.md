*For "Off the Grid... and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design" by Geoff Boeing

I really appreaciate that Professor Boeing's article presents how the spatial data could be a powerful tool to reveal inspiring planning findings. It’s interesting to read this article during our research process for the final project. I’m really amazed by the polar histogram he made to present the orientation of the street network. Data cannot lead to serious insights without being empowered by clear and innovative representation. This series of diagrams and the Grid Index, compared by other traditional data results such as the average of numbers, make me catch up with the key issues and findings immediately, which makes this project very effective and useful. In addition, I appreciate his detailed explanation of the research process (e.g., data sources, method, analysis) so that I have the opportunity to understand the potential issues that I may encounter in the process. For example, he adopts both the primary method and earliest and assessor methods to make sure the data estimation is closest to the real-world scenario. Validation of data requires the researchers’ attention to detail and creativity to look for alternative “next-best” options. Similarly, he found out that car ownership correlates both the griddedness, which he wants to verify for, and other variables such as household size. This realization is critical because it allows the conclusion, in the end, more valid. Lastly, I find what makes him a good planner is how he can go beyond the data conclusion and apply it back to real-world problems. The data he first got is a smart conversion from the real-world form to the raw numbers and texts. However, the policy implication he got, in the end, is definitely another example that to explain the data in the real world language is as important as doing the data analysis.
