This week, I read “Global Trends Toward Urban Street-Network Sprawl” (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2019) and really appreciate how they record, quantify and theorize the street network in relation to urban development and condition. As for the research method, I really like how the planar street “patterns” are transformed into the insights in the form of the index (SNDi) and empirical street network types – they provide a straightforward way for us as the audience to view, compare, and understand the street network of all global cities. This is definitely something we have to learn for our final project. In addition, I really like the point of “persistence” of the street network – the relationship between and after was found and hence can help predict the development pattern going forward. 

As for the questions, I like the paper’s focus on the street network as a whole. However, I’m curious if it’s easier to give more classification to the streets (e.g., highway, pedestrian-only path) and if the understanding of different types of the street would help lead to more insights? Also, I know transit is not a focus in this topic, but I’m wondering if transit networks can be added into those maps a different level as well? I’m just curious to see if those underground subways (such as in NYC and London) or ferry-oriented cities (such as Amsterdam) would affect the urban development pattern as well.
