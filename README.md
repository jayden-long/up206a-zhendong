# About Myself: 

My name is Jayden Zhendong Long, a first-year MURP student. I currently concentrate on Regional and International Development (RID) and potentially do a secondary concentration in transportation. Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of economic development and land use along with transportation. 

# About This Class:

UP 206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science is a class taught by Professor Yoh Kawano at UCLA Luskin. This is an opportunity for all students to explore the foundations of spatial data science and coding information. The class includes introductions to the coding program Python and asks the students to explore their own research interests with real-world data. 

# About Projecct Ideas:

I'm interested in transportation topics and hope to explore the Transit-Oriented Development model in this class. For now, I'm thinking of using the spatial data to figure out how to select the best sites for the TOD communities. Also, since I used to study and work in New York, I'm interested in the Long Island region and the MTA's Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) as the contexts for the class project.

# About Objectives for Class:

Without too much prior coding experiences, I hope to use this class as an opportunity to gain working knowledge and technical skills in coding in the planning sector. I also understand working with data is a way of thinking, and I also hope to integrate data analysis thinking into my future studies and work in the planning field.
