# About Myself: 

My name is Jayden Zhendong Long, a first-year MURP student. I currently concentrate on Regional and International Development (RID) and potentially do a secondary concentration in Transportation. 

# About Projecct Ideas:

I'm interested in transportation topics and hope to explore the Transit-Oriented Development model in this class. For now, I'm thinking to use the spatial data to explore the site selection for the TOD communities. Also, since I used to study and work in New York, I'm interested in the Long Island region and the MTA's Long Island RailRoad as the contexts for the class project.

# About Objectives for Class:

Without too much prior coding experiences, I hope to use this class as an opportunity to learn the gain a working knowledge and technical skills in coding in the planning sector. In addition, I understand working with data is a way of thinking, and I also hope to integrate that into my future ideoglogy.
