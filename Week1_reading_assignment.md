# Week 1 Reading Assignment

In the essay "Integrating Geographic Analysis in Transport Planning", the author Lovelace presents a history of data application in the transportation planning sector and argues how the application of data and computation fills planners' needs and further advances the thinking of transportation planning. Lovelace thinks an ideal transportation planning shall be a combination of “broader democratic processes and local geographic contexts”, which requires geographic data collection and analysis along with the transparency and the inclusiveness of the planning process. In the light of the proprietary and exclusive traditional transportation planning software, three open-source ecosystems – R, Python, and QGIS – were prevailed to support the production of evidence-based planning policies with a more “transparent, accessible, and participatory” process.

The essay presents to me a broader picture of data as a way of thinking rather than a simple technical tool for planning works. The shift of transportation planning software and mechanisms illustrates the power of data and open-source platform – they are used to look for the problems and solutions more efficiently and more collectively. This resonates with my searching process for the project's initial data this week: the data is everywhere and provided by governmental authorities and local organizations doing research and analysis. Everyone contributes a little piece of information and insight to form a meaningful result. On the other hand, no data is enough to present the whole picture of the questions the planners look for. Instead, the planners shall use different pieces of data wisely to look for the answers.
